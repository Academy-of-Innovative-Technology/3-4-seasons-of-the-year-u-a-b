# 🌦️ Seasons of the Year — Web Design Project

## 📘 Project Overview

You will create a **seasonal grid** that displays the four seasons of the year using **JavaScript arrays and iterators**. Each season will contain the correct months and visually represent that season using images of your choice.

This project focuses on:

- Organizing data with arrays

- Looping through data using iterators

- Dynamically displaying content in the DOM

## 🎯 Project Objective

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Group months into their correct seasons using arrays

- Use loops to process and display data dynamically

- Insert images and text into HTML using JavaScript

- Style a grid layout using CSS

---

## ✅ Instructions

1. **Season Variables**
   - You will be given predefined variables for each season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall).
   - Assign the correct months to each season using arrays.

2. **Images**
   - Find images that represent **each season** (your choice).
   - Store images in the same order as the months for that season.

3. **JavaScript Logic**
   - Use an iterator to loop through the seasons and months.
   - Dynamically generate the HTML using `template literals and backticks` content for each season and its images.

4. **Display**
   - Render all seasons in the browser as a **grid layout**.
   - Each season should clearly display:
     - The season name
     - Associated months
     - Corresponding images

## 🧠 Requirements

### 📜 JavaScript

You must use **all** of the following:

- Arrays `[ ]`
- Iterators  
  - `for()`  
  - `.forEach()`  
  - or `for...in`
- Template literals (backticks) `` ` ` ``
- `document.querySelector()`
  - `.insertAdjacentHTML()`
  - `.innerHTML`
  - `.src`

---

### 🎨 CSS

Your project must include styles using:

- `width`
- `height`
- `border`
- `background-color`
- `font-family`
- `font-size`

---

## ⭐ Advanced Challenge (+1 Point)

- Use **a single loop** to process **all months and images**
- Display all season data dynamically in the HTML without repeating code

---

## 📌 Tips for Success

- Organize your data before writing your loops

- Match months and images by index

- Keep your code clean and readable

- Test often in the browser as you build
